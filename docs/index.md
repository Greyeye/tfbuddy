# TFBuddy - Terraform Cloud workflow engine

## What is TF Buddy
TF Buddy is an application meant to simplify executing terraform in your pull requests. It supports Github, and Gitlab and Terraform Cloud Workspaces currently. TF Buddy has been in use at Zapier, in production for the past 9 months, and is still under active development.

## Why TF Buddy?

1. Apply before merging your pull requests
1. Cleaner breakdown of what's going to change in your pull request
1. Keep your TFC workspaces in API-drive / CLI-drive mode so you can still use the `terraform` CLI for maintenance actions not easily achieved via GitOps.
